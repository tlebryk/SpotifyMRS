      <p> Spotify is a music streaming platform with over 191 million users (“Spotify Technology S.A. Announces” 2018), making it one of the most popular music streaming softwares in the world. Spotify hosts over 40 million songs which users can organize into personal playlists.
One of Spotify’s core features is providing a music recommendation system (MRS). As users craft playlists, Spotify provides suggestions for songs a user might add to a playlist. Besides general playlist generation, we aimed to tackle the “cold start” problem – that is, how to generate a playlist with a limited number of starting tracks to infer from. We look to tackle this problem by using collaborative filtering. This solution was meant to keep the project simple and clean: that is, to avoid using other datasets which might encounter fuzzy matching problems or overly complicated hybrid methods that, based on our surprisingly good results, are only likely to produce marginal gains in test accuracy.

        <img style="padding: 0 15px float: left," src="graph.png" width="599" height="442"  align=”right” alt=""> The logo in the navbar is now a default Bootstrap feature in Bootstrap 4! Make sure to set the width and height of the logo within the HTML. For best results, it's recommended that you use an SVG image as your logo.

      <p>
        This website consists of five other sections: results from data exploration, a literature review of prior attempts at tackling this problem, <a href="model.html">overview of our model</a>, a report of our findings, and a conclusion explaining the implications of our work and future ways to improve upon it.
